You will need the node_modules to start, we didnt submit them because the folder size was too big.
To do this type: npm install

Starting:

To start bank-api, go to where the file is located, open cmd and type: node server.js

To start bank-frontend, go to where the file is located, open cmd and type: npm start


On App:

Once the app opens you will be taken straight to the login page (even if you try make a payment it will tell you to login first)
There are 2 accounts for this Login screen, both are static and their info is:

Account Number: 123456 Password: pass123
Account Number: 987654 Password: mypassword

Once you login you will be taken to the payment page. (there are example SWIFT codes on the side to assist)
